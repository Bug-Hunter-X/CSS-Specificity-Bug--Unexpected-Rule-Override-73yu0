The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This rule is less specific than expected */
}
```

In this example, you might expect the paragraph (`<p>`) nested inside the `div` to inherit the `color: green` style.  However, due to CSS specificity rules, the more general `p { color: red; }` rule overrides `div p { color: green; }`.  This is counter-intuitive because `div p` seems more specific, but it isn't. Both rules have equal specificity, with the latter being applied because it appears later in the CSS.

This type of problem is often subtle and hard to debug without understanding the nuances of CSS specificity.
