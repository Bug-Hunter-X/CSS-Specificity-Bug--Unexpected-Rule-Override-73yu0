The solution involves increasing the specificity of the rule targeting the paragraph inside the `div`. This can be achieved using a more specific selector or by using the `!important` flag (generally discouraged except in very specific circumstances). Here's an improved version:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green !important; /* More specific rule */
}

/*Alternatively, a more specific selector can be used to ensure higher specificity.*/
div > p {
  color: green; /* More specific selector*/
}
```

Using `!important` should generally be avoided as it can make CSS harder to maintain in the long run. Prioritizing more specific selectors is the best practice for resolving such issues.
